    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past, online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detalied descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirments they may have. Ordering online by tiecking a box and paying for the meals online can eliminate the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <p class="list-grou-item-text col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-3 col-xs-12">1. ACCURACY
    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure time records and minimalize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data therby helps to provide accurate performances and payrell data.
    <br>
    2. ECONOMICS Have you ever though that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to innacurate time reporting, buddy punching, absent, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Assium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per emplyee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
    <br>
    3. PRODUCTIVITY/EFFICIENCY Monitoring and managing attendance manually can time consuming, laborous, and expensive. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authoritive leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which leads to increased productivity and improved profits, and many more like visiblity/insights, hassle-free workflow management, flexibility, intergration/configuration, real-time tracking, security, and compliance.
